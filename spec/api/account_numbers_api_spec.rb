  # unit tests for get_account_numbers
  # /links/{id}/accounts/numbers
  # Returns a list of open, permissioned accounts associated with a &lt;a href&#x3D;#tag/Links&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;,         including full account and routing numbers for appropriate accounts (such as checking and savings accounts).         &lt;p&gt;**Note** that this endpoint does **not** trigger a fetch of account numbers from the institution; it merely returns         account numbers that have already been fetched, either because &#x60;prefetch&#x60; was requested when the link was created,         or because of an on-demand update.  **To force a check for new/updated account numbers, you must use the         &lt;a href&#x3D;#operation/refresh_products&gt;/products&lt;/a&gt; endpoint.**         &lt;p&gt;If you have requested prefetch or an on-demand update, you should check the &#x60;refreshed_at&#x60; date     for this product in the returned response, and compare that against the previous &#x60;refreshed_at&#x60; date, which you can     get from any previous response for this or any other account or link request.  If the refreshed_at date has not     increased, then updated data is not yet available.
